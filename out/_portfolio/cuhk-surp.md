**Abstract:**

Created a VR/MR game on the Oculus Quest 2 to facilitate stroke patients rehabilitation through exercise.


**Background:**
Stroke is a major cause of adult disability, with about 80% of survivors experiencing upper limb dysfunction. Sadly, around 60% of stroke patients don't fully recover arm function. However, even in the chronic phase, it's possible to improve motor skills. To achieve this, we need at least 500 repetitions per session, as it triggers the brain's ability to adapt and recover function. Traditional stroke rehabilitation usually falls far short of this goal, averaging only 38 repetitions of active exercises per session.


**Objective:**
Our goal is to leverage virtual reality to significantly increase the number of exercise repetitions stroke patients can perform. By introducing interactivity and gamification to otherwise repetitive and monotonous exercises, we aim to make rehabilitation more engaging and effective.

**Inspiration:**

Atari - 

•Movement
is restricted in 2d plane → only moving left-right

•Likely
to be elderly people, wanted to create a game they might be familiar with

**Result:**

Created Pong game in VR and MR, can be used with hand tracking, with a score counter, game ending, and instructions in chinese.
